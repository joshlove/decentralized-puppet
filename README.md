# decentralized-puppet
Goal is to come up with a simple decentralized puppet kicker similar to the one I use everyday at work. 

Desired functionality:
1. Write up a puppet manifest
2. Modules should be included via librarian-puppet or r10k (puppetfile)
3. deploy to a target, manifest runs on that target.
4. Ability to do some minimal environment prep through cap3 recipes.
